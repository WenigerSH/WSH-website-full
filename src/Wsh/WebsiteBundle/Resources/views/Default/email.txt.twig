{{ random('honest - It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.', 'aesthetic - The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.', 'long-lasting - It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today's throwaway society.', 'environmentally friendly - Good software makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the business processes.', 'useful - A software is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.', 'understandable - It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user's intuition.  At best, it is self-explanatory.', 'unobtrusive - Software fulfilling a purpose is like tool. It is not neither decorative object nor work of art.  It’s design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.', 'innovative - The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.', 'human - Software, opposed to physical objects should be as human as possible having it’s own ego.  Being smart and intelligent encourages interactions with users, not only in domain of business process or task but also in domain of emotional attachment to product and it’s soul.') }}
